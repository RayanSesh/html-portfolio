<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering. Early part of my career is spent in India in manufacturing and new project execution.  
</p>

<p>Subseqently I immigrated into Canada. Qualified myself further in Computer Programming and Analysis. After this, I gathered many years of experience in Computer Hardware and software.</p>

<p>I own and maintain 3 websites since 2009. One is a blog talking about my views of the world on the web.
    Second is a data driven website, that talks about investing in stocks and bonds and finally the third acts as a guide in the selection of laptops/notebooks for a given use.
